  ## Description
  This is a E-Commerce website for Dead Faces clothing brand that has been revamped from it's original Shopify website. We have created a Postgres SQL database for all of the products, sizes, users & cart information. We completely redesigned the user interface and added admin functionality. This site also has a fully functional shopping cart and we used Stripe for payment checkout.

  ## Installation
  The following technology was used to create this application: VS code, Insomnia, PGAdmin 4, GitHub, Render, PostGres SQL, Bulma CSS Framework, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars and the following NPM packages Bcrypt, Connect-session-sequalize, Dotenv, Express, Express-fileupload, Express-handlebars, Express-session, nodemon, packages, PG, Sequalize, Stripe, Swiper.

  ## Usage
  This website will be used to sell products from the Dead Faces clothing brand. The site starts off at the homepage where you will be greeted by the brand logo, home and login buttons to the left in the nav bar and to the right you will have the brands social media links. Then you will treated to a carousel of the brands products that you can swipe through with a short description listed below the images. When you click on a specific image, it will take you to the product description page. There you will have a description and image of the product with the sizes available. You will also see an alert stating "Log in to purchase item". You will either need to log in or create an account to purchase items from this site. Once logged in, you will have a drop down list of sizes, quantity that you would like to purchase and an "add to cart" button. Also, if you are an admin to this site, you will have an extra button "update this item", which will take you to the update item page where you can update/add/delete an image, type of item, design title, color, price and sizes available. Once you add an item to cart, you will be taken to your cart where the item will be listed along with the size, price, quantity selected and sub-total. There is also a delete button, checkout or continue shopping. Continue shopping will take you back to the main page and checkout will take you to Stripe's third party payment checkout system, where you will have a total amount, G-Pay option or add a credit card option. There is also a back button that will take you back to the shopping cart.
